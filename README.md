# PSO VISUALIZER
Visualizes the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) using python and matplotlib.
Generates a GIF file, which shows the optimization of a 2D function.
Please note that the program inserts frames in the gif between the actual iterations of the PSO algorithm. Without doing this, the particles would just "teleport" around and the viewer could not understand what is happening.


## Example
The program will render a GIF like this:
